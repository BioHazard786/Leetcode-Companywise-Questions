I am using Next.js 15 in this project, with React 19.

Source code is in src folder, and the main entry point is in src/app/layout.tsx. The project uses TypeScript for type safety.

The project is structured with a focus on components, routes, and utilities. The main components are located in the `src/components` directory. Utility functions and types can be found in `src/lib`, server actions are written in `src/server/actions`, schema is written in `src/lib/schema`.

This project uses shadcn UI for the UI components, which provides a set of pre-designed components that can be easily integrated into the Next.js application.

This Project also use Nuqs for search params and tanstack table for data display.
